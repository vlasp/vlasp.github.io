    <h1>On likelihoods</h1>
    <p>
        I have always had skeptical intuitions. However, the way that these intuitions have manifested have evolved over time.
        I remember the first time I was pressed on my belief in god by my brother, who asked me what probability I put on god
        existing. At the time, I said 50%, with there being a 50% likelihood in athiesm and a 50% likelihood in any form of
        theism.
    </p>
    <p>
        After this conversation, I realized that this answer did not fully satisfy me. I was skeptical, but the indifference
        principle (putting equal likelihood in all possible choices) led to some weird conclusions based on the way I 
        subjectively decided to categorize the possibilities. I was splitting on athiesm/theism, but what if I decided to split
        on athiesm/deism/personal god? Would I now say there is a 2/3 chance that god exists? And conceivably I could come up
        with infinite hypothesis, one where the personal god prefers humans, or one where the personal god prefers the color red,
        and so on and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
        This half-baked idea made its way into a conversation I was having during a study session with my university's EA group,
        where they asked me what probability I would put on god's existence. I said "I don't know". They then pressed, saying
        "If you were forced to put a probability on it, what would you pick", to which I genuinely didn't know. This conversation
        ended with me saying I would rather die than be forced to put a probability on god's existence. Looking back, I don't
        know if I would endorse this view, but still it seems impossible to put a probability on this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another example of this situation arising was at an retreat we did for my university's EA group. I was having a conversation
        regarding morality, and my interlocutor said that one of the big names in EA (I think it was William MacAskill or Toby Ord)
        had some argument about believing in moral realism even if there isn't a watertight argument for it. In this argument,
        there is the implicit assumption that you place some probability on moral realism being true. This seemed absurd to me.
        How can we have a probability about something being true if all evidence supports not only it, but also every other
        viable hypothesis? And if we were to say "But some observations are more likely under moral realism than not", I'm sure I
        could just construct an anti-realist hypothesis that takes that observation into account. I eventually said that not only
        do I not have a probability on moral realism being true, I don't have a probability on any non-falsifiable claim being true.
        This forced me to bite a bullet saying I cannot outright dismiss the existence of an invisible fountain of youth in front
        of me that will give me eternal youth if only were I to pray to it. This seemed like an easy bullet for me to bite, but
        my interlocutor thought this was absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
        This conversation led me to want to try to justify my beliefs. Then, I came across 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvcGW40risE">a video from Kane Baker titled "Dogmatic Skepticism"</a>. I wasn't
        expecting to hear a defense of my view, but in the last five minutes, Kane gives his solution to the problems with
        skepticism that he detailed in the beginning of the video, and he calls it "Unspecified suspension skepticism", where
        the probability of a certain hypothesis consistent with the hypothesis is either undefined, or uniform along [0, 1].
        This view matches my intuitions, and he shows how it avoids the problems of both dogmatic skepticism and specified
        suspension skepticism that I had trouble with before as well. This was a major relief to me, knowing that my view had
        some validity to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, now I had another issue. It's all fine and well to claim that I don't have a probability on the existence of god,
        or on the existence of moral facts. However, I do have a probability of the Mavericks winning their first round matchup
        against the Los Angeles Clippers. Is there a relevant distinction here, or am I acting in contradiction?
