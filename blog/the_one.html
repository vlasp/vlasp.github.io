        who is "the one"? i read <a href="https://www.betonit.ai/p/shes-the-one">this post by bryan caplan</a> cuz it was
        on the slatestarcodex subreddit, and while i don't agree with everything in there, there were some thoughts that i
        had been having that arose again after reading the post. (tangent: i remember reading a quote very recently about
        how the most profound statements to someone are the ones that make them think about thoughts they have already had,
        and while i can't find the exact quote (chat gpt seems to make up quotes from robert frost and johann wolfgang von
        goethe), i think its probably true).

        first was the idea that you can become physically attracted to someone as you date them, as long as their personality
        is a fit. i kind of agree - i remember when i was with my college girlfriend, the first month when i was dating her
        i would see her out and about and wonder "if i saw her in this situation without knowing her, would i approach her?"
        and i felt guilty for thinking "no" (she was still objectively attractive). however, after about a year of dating, 
        every time i saw her, she looked like the prettiest girl in the world. however, i feel like there also comes a point 
        where you have to weigh your current preferences against your future preferences. would current me really want to date 
        someone in 10 years who current me would think is someone i am "settling" for? (tangent: this feels like the entire 
        problem  with dating in new york city, which i will be doing in a couple of months once i move there, where everyone 
        feels like they have options even if what is in front of them is good enough for long term happiness). i'm not sure
        what exactly my strategy will be with dating in new york with regard to this - there's that whole thing about how
        once you go on 37 dates or whatever, you have established a baseline and can then confidently pick the next best
        person to commit to, but i'm also moving to new york for experiences, and i would be robbing myself of experiencing
        dating interesting people if i commit early enough. one of my friends moved to new york because the girl he started
        dating a month prior was also moving to new york, and he told me in similar enough words that he wants to see how i
        experience dating in new york since he was robbed of that experience. i also generally date a very homogenous people - 
        well-educated, well-mannered, polite, and quiet, and when i went on a date with a girl who did not go to college, was
        extremely extroverted, an alcoholic with a dui, and worked in the service industry, i felt as if it was a very
        enriching experience, and a reminder that i am in a bubble. i think this is something i'll have to play by ear once i
        move there.
