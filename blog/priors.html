    <h1>priors</h1>
    <h2>04/18/2024</h2>
    <p>
        people say that skepticism is one of the baby stages of people who get into philosophy.
        i seem to be stuck in that phase. i am an agnostic about most things, including god,
        morality, free will, the existence of true contradictions, and even of the external world.
        i take after a youtuber named kane baker. he has a phd in philosophy (more specifically
        the philosophy of science) and makes youtube videos about general philosophical topics.
        his videos awaken the skeptic inside me about any topic he discusses. i had skeptical
        intuitions about morality, the existence of god, and free will before i started watching
        his videos, but his videos on skepticism about things like the external world, the existence
        of true contradictions, and our memories led me to realize that my epistemic system leads
        me to be skeptical of those things as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        this epistemic system, which i have had intuitions about, is described by kane as "unspecified
        suspension skepticism", in which i have no priors about any hypothesis that has not had at
        least one observation resolve. for example, i do have priors about the hypothesis that the
        nba team that makes the most three-pointers in a game will win the game, because i have seen
        that hypothesis resolve many times. contrast this to the hypothesis that god/morality/any other
        similar thing exists. i have no priors about those hypotheses because i have not seen them resolve.
        we have no prior resolutions of universes in which god/morality/free will either exist or do not
        exist, so i have no priors at all about those things.

        one of my friend's brothers is a philosophy major who does online debates and used to be a part of
        the "ask yourself" community. he is now a proponent of the psychophysical argument for god. i find
        this argument interesting but unconvincing due to my epistemic system, and i hope that explaining it
        may elucidate how my epistemic system works. the claim in the argument is that there is no inherent
        reason for our experiences to map on to physical states of the brain, so the best explanation for
        why they do is that god exists. based on my understanding of function approximators, the first statement
        actually seems agreeable, since logically there are infinite functions that take some input <i>x</i>
        from the external world and produce some experience <i>e</i>, and from that experience <i>e</i> output
        some action <i>y</i>. based on this, the proponents of the argument claim that the unlikelyhood of
        our experiences mapping on to physical states of the brain is extremely high. and if a critic were to
        say that it may be metaphisically impossible for our experiences to not map on to physical states of the
        brain, the proponents of the argument appeal to a more extreme case: imagine a world where there are
        rocks floating in space that all say, in plain english, "god exists". it seems absurd to say that
        even if it may be metaphysically impossible for the rocks to not say "god exists" in this world, that
        you should not update your beliefs about god's existence based on the rocks. the proponent of the argument
        claims that this shows that the metaphysical possibility about an alternate hypothesis need not be the
        determining factor in deciding your priors about a given hypothesis, and that merely the conceivability of 
        an alternate hypothesis is enough to update your priors. the same applies to our experiences mapping on to 
        physical states of the brain, since there does not seem to be a symmetry breaker.
    </p>
    <p>
        however, this presupposes that the critic has priors about the existence of god. I do not, so there are 
        no priors for me to update. similarly, i have a problem with the conceivability argument. what does the
        role of conceivability play in determining priors? and on what level are we actually conceiving of
        alternate hypothesis? can our minds conceive of possible worlds, down to the fabric of the universe?
        it doesn't seem so, based on how dreams often break physics, and we are continually surprised when we
        make new discoveries about the universe. so it seems that we can only conceive of alternate hypotheses
        on a surface level, and that we cannot conceive of the fabric of the universe. so it seems that our
        conceivability intuitions are not reliable, and that we should not update our priors based on them.

        i have an exam early next week, and one of the topics covered is bayesian updating as it relates to machine
        learning. i hoped that this post would help me understand the topic better, but it seems that i went on a tangent
        and in machine learning we always have a given prior (normally a normal distribution) and are asked to update
        based on data that has already resolved. i hope that i can understand the topic better before the exam, and that 
        i can get a good grade on it. i don't really need the good grade, i just need to pass since i have a job offer that
        requires me to finish my masters by june 4th. however, i got an a- in one of my classes and that kind of annoyed me, 
        so i want to avoid getting more annoyed. also i don't think my job checks for transcripts, so i don't even need to
        pass, so i'm not sure why i'm so driven to get a good grade. sucks to be me i guess.

        when writing the above paragraph, i realized i should examine the distribution i have for priors after very
        limited data, or data that is only weakly related. for example, if in the nba example i only saw the hypothesis
        resolve once (to true), what would my prior distribution look like? the domain of hypothesis is from [0,1],
        and this domain should probably inform the prior distribution. i think the prior distribution would be a
        distribution that scales linearly from 0 to 1, like a ramp. actually, i need to think about this more. it's
        almost 3 am and i haven't eaten dinner. i should probably go to bed. i'll write more about this later.
